- name: A Model and Application for Cross-domain Visualization System Design
  description: Visualization design studies are notoriously difficult to design effectively. Though existing models highlight the major pitfalls, their guidance is not as user-friendly for individuals new to design studies. We present an updated design study model providing step-by-step guidelines, concrete examples, and discussion of differences and similarities between design studies in eight different domains.  To demonstrate the value of our model and guidelines, we apply them in the security domain to help fledgling analysts reverse engineer (RE) Android applications (apps) for potential security and privacy vulnerabilities. Through our design study, we develop TraceInspector, an interactive visualization tool that integrates both static and dynamic Android app data, connects relevant temporal event sequences and method dependencies, and executes app code in a single visualization interface. Finally, we evaluate TraceInspector with nine RE users and find that the tool eases the learning of RE tasks for novice RE users, validating our synthesized design study guidance.

- name: Debugging Database Queries&#58; A Survey of Tools, Techniques, and Users
  description: Database management systems (or DBMSs) have been around for decades, and yet are still difficult to use, particularly when trying to identify and fix errors in user programs (or queries). We seek to understand what methods have been proposed to help people debug database queries, and whether these techniques have ultimately been adopted by DBMSs (and users). We conducted an interdisciplinary review of 112 papers and tools from the database, visualization and HCI communities. To better understand whether academic and industry approaches are meeting the needs of users, we interviewed 20 database users (and some designers), and found surprising results. In particular, there seems to be a wide gulf between users' debugging strategies and the functionality implemented in existing DBMSs, as well as proposed in the literature. In response, we propose new design guidelines to help system designers to build features that more closely match users debugging strategies.
