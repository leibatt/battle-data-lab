  <ul style="overflow: hidden">
  <li> I am a PhD student researching and building interactive data analytic systems as part of the BAD Lab, under advisor Dr. Leilani Battle. Before entering the program, I spent four years as a software developer at Microsoft, actively working on client side software in the Windows Phone and Skype for Business divisions. This got me invested in prioritizing user experience during system development. I've also spent two years working on personal start-up projects, which planted the motivational seeds for my current research. I am a proud Terp alum! I graduated from the University of Maryland with undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Economics. When Iâ€™m not working towards another degree, youâ€™ll probably find me in the kitchen cooking up a storm! </li>
