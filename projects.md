            Keeping abreast of current trends, technologies, and best practices in statistics, visualization, and data analysis is becomingincreasingly difficult even for professional data scientists, and is a hopeless endeavor for domain experts lacking time and trainingin these methods.  In this paper, we propose Lodestar, an interactive visualization notebook that allows the user to perform visualdata analysis by selecting from a list of recommendations. Selecting a recommendation adds the corresponding Python code to thenotebook and executes it, thus generating new output; no programming expertise is required on behalf of the user. The recommendationmechanism is inspired byautocompletemechanisms, where a partial query is used to show suggestions for how to finish the query. Inour implementation, we derive our recommendations from a directed graph of analysis states: one manually curated from online datascience tutorials, another by automatically analyzing the Python code from a corpus of approximately 6,000 Jupyter notebooks on datascience. We demonstrate the Lodestar approach through a set of examples involving statistics, machine learning, and visualization.

        <div class="caption"> Figure: Lodestar interface. The top panel (A) provides a data selection menu. (B) and (D) are recommendation panels (DESCRIPTION is selected for this notebook) combining suggested analysis steps from various sources (called advisors). (C) and (E) are analysis cells, each with multiple tabs: “Analysis Results” gives charts or tables, “Output Dataframe” and “Code Script” shows the outputs and current code block, and “What’s this analysis?” gives a brief description of the analyses. Outputs, code scripts, and charts can be exported into files by clicking on the associated buttons.

            <h2>User Behaviour Modelling during Examination of Massive Medical Images</h2>
            Digital pathology is replacing pathological examinations performed using microscope, due to its advantage of faster examination and better collaboration among pathologists all over the world. It makes use of super-resolution whole slide images of tissues, which are maintained on a centralized server and accessed by pathologists over the internet, using a client computer (e.g., a laptop). The huge memory footprint of these images makes it difficult for pathologists to navigate and interact with them, as these images cannot be fit entirely in the main memory of the client system. A more effective approach would be to develop an image viewer that automatically and efficiently pre-fetches only the necessary parts of each image from the server, on demand. Furthermore, the system should perform this transfer of data over the network with low latency, so as to have a smooth, lag-free examination experience. We aim to predict the behaviour of pathologists during an ongoing examination session and pre-fetch the required data by training deep learning models on the interaction history of pathologists, and the tissue image itself. Using this approach, we can automatically fetch what pathologists will look for in advance, which would help in reducing perceived system delays and thus make the image browsing experience appear more interactive and smooth.

            <h2 class="project-name">Notebook Evolution</h2>
            Computational notebooks are a popular medium for data analysts to record the methods and observations of the data analysis process. The increasing number of notebooks being added to GitHub not only show the popularity of this platform but also provide for a great resource to observe the trends in Data Analysis. Leveraging the snapshot nature of GitHub repositories can help us understand the analysis process across time. Given what we know about the data analysis process, how well do the tools of today perform in aiding analysts? We scrape all of the public notebooks from GitHub and observe: the trends in API usage and data analysts behavior with computation notebooks across time. We use this data to study whether popular data analysis tools support these behaviors. We use this as a means to evaluate the efficacy of those tools.

            Data visualizations are used to help people understand and interpret data in efficient ways. Data Driven Documents (D3) is used to create data visualizations. The issue is many people have difficulty coding in D3. These people turn to Stack Overflow, Reddit, and GitHub for online support. Our research mainly contains two parts: data scraping and data analysis. We are using beautifulsoup and selenium to scrape data, and then we conduct qualitative analysis.

            <h2 class="project-name">LogVis</h2>
            Android being a call-back oriented language has a series of internal conditional triggering’s being made when an application is launched. These triggering’s are called call-backs which may access permissions without the knowledge of the user. This poses mass vulnerabilities involved in using applications and a threat to users data. To understand the true triggering’s and what is causing them, analysts would like to observe application at runtime. <i>Maryland Cybersecurity Center (MC2)</i> developed an Android Analytics Tools; <i>Hogarth</i> which dynamically traces the logs on application launch. For this purpose there is a need to log the calls being made and Hogarth uses Redexer for the same. However, outputs provided by these applications are very textual or work-flow based which enforces a lot of cognitive load on the user and jumping of applications from log files to source code files. For helping analysts work more efficiently with these logs, LogVis, is an interactive visualisation tool which encompasses procedures of what a reverse engineer does to analyse dynamic trace of a running application.
