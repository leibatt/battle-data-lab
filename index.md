    The Battle Data Lab develops innovative, data driven technology to aid analysts in performing complex data
    exploration and analysis. We work directly with experts from a variety of domains to better understand the role of
    interactive systems within the data analysis process. We tackle challenging data science problems by integrating
    methodology and techniques from visualization, human-computer interaction and databases into tangible systems. To
    test our results, we develop automated benchmarks, which promote systematic and repeatable evaluation of interactive
    data analysis systems.
